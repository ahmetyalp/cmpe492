However Eve, their curious friend, wants to know what they will talk about. <br>\n","Asja and Balvis found a solution involving a \"one-time pad\". Before Balvis leaves, they randomly produce a binary string. When Asja wants to send a message,  she first $XOR$s her message bit by bit with this string, and after Belvis gets the message, he $XOR$s again with the same string. By this method Belvis is able to decode the message and read what Asja sent. <br> \n","In this situation Eve, who is eavesdropping on the conversation and obtains a copy of the sent message, can't decode the message because there are too many ($2^n$ if Asja sends a $n$-bit long message)  possible strings Asja and Balvis can produce. <br>\n","However Asja and Balvis have to produce new keys each time they want to communicate. But Asja and Balvis can produce only a finite number of bits before Balvis leaves, so they will run out of unused bits sooner or later. If one uses the same key more than once, there are methods that enable Eve to gain some information about the messages.\n","\n","Quantum Key Distribution solves this problem. We can use the nature of quantum information to generate new keys even when Asja and Balvis are far from each other. <br>\n","\n","There are several protocols for QKD. We will see BB84, developed by [Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bennetc/BB84highest.pdf)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rxbAJOTSe488","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Distributing the Key \n","\n","One day Asja misses Balvis, so they decide to generate a new key to talk securely. <br>\n","Asja will be sending quantum bits instead of classical bits at the beginning of the key production process. <br>\n","## Bell basis\n","\n","Our classical computational basis states are $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ and $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ . If we apply a Hadamard gate to these states, we obtain  $ \\frac{ \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\lvert 1 \\rangle }{\\sqrt{2}}$ and  $ \\frac{ \\lvert 0 \\rangle - \\lvert 1 \\rangle }{\\sqrt{2}}$, respectively. Note that these two new states are orthogonal as well. We can use any two orthogonal  states as basis. So these two states will form a new basis that is called the Bell basis. If we think of $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ and $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ as $\\uparrow$ and $\\rightarrow$, respectively, then the Bell basis states can be abbreviated as $\\nearrow$ and $\\searrow$.\n","\n","Asja will be sending a sequence of randomly produces \"0\" or \"1\"s. She will not be using the computational basis for all those values. She will decide whether to use the computational basis or the Bell basis for each of those bits randomly. So she will be sending a random sequence consisting of $\\uparrow$, $\\rightarrow$, $\\nearrow$ and $\\searrow$s. And she will not be telling what basis she will use for each bit to Balvis beforehand. <br>\n","\n","Measurements in the computational basis always yield $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ (or, according to our new notation, $\\uparrow$ or $\\rightarrow$).  <br>\n","Every time Balvis receives a qubit from Asja, he randomly decides which basis to use to measure this state. If he decides to measure in the Bell basis, he just applies a Hadamard gate to the qubit and then measures it in the computational basis. You can see that this procedure converts  $\\nearrow$ and $\\searrow$ to $\\uparrow$ and $\\rightarrow$, respectively. <br>\n","\n","\n","\n","What if Balvis chooses the wrong basis for a particular qubit? Let us say that Asja sends a $\\nearrow$, and Balvis uses the computational basis ($\\uparrow$ and $\\rightarrow$) for the measurement. $\\nearrow$ is  $ \\frac{ \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\lvert 1 \\rangle }{\\sqrt{2}}$, so if we measure this state in the computational basis, we will see $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ with probabillty $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2$ each. Verify that Balvis will get random results with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ in all other cases where he has picked the wrong basis.\n","\n","When there is no eavesdropping, the BB84 protocol works as follows: <br>\n","* Asja creates quantum states randomly in either of the four cases,  $\\uparrow$, $\\rightarrow$, $\\nearrow$ or $\\searrow$, and sends them to Balvis. She records the bits and the bases that she used.\n","* Balvis measures all these states by randomly deciding on a basis for each of them.\n","* If he chooses the wrong basis then he gets a random result for that bit, otherwise, he gets same bit that Asja sent.\n","\n","After this process, Asja and Balvis talk openly, using classical bits, about which basis choices they happened to agree on.\n","\n","\n","* They discard the bits which got measured using the wrong basis.\n","* The remaining qubits are same on both Asja and Balvis. So they have a common key. <br>\n","\n","But what happens if Eve listens to the channel? <br>\n","\n","There are a few important assumptions. First, our quantum channel is error-free.

Because Eve's interference has some impacts on measurements which Balvis got, Asja and Balvis will be using some of the qubits to check for the presence of Eve. \n","\n","The BB84 protocol works as follows: <br>\n","* Asja creates quantum states randomly in either of the four cases,  $\\uparrow$, $\\rightarrow$, $\\nearrow$ or $\\searrow$, and sends them to Balvis. She records the bits and the bases that she used.\n","* Balvis measures all these states by randomly deciding on a basis for each of them.\n","* If he chooses the wrong basis then he should get a random result for that bit, otherwise, he should get same bit that Asja sent.\n","\n","After this process, Asja and Balvis talk openly, using classical bits, about which basis choices they happened to agree on.\n","\n","* They discard the bits which got measured using the wrong basis.\n","* They take the remaining bits and divide them to two equal size groups randomly. <br>\n","* They will openly compare the results of the measurements that Balvis got on each qubit in first group. If they find a conflict, they will abort the protocol.\n","* Bits in the second group should be same on both sides if Eve has not interfered. So they have a common secret key. <br>\n","\n","Because the probabilty that Asja and Balvis use same basis for one qubit is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the protocol uses half of the bits which got measured using same basis to detect Eve, we need $4n$ qubits to get $n$-bit long key."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hq63zMrn8aId","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Calculating the Probabilty that Asja and Balvis do not Notice Eve\n","\n","Assume that Eve listens to the quantum channel between Asja and Balvis. She captures the qubits that Asja sends, makes measurements in a randomly selected basis for every qubit because she has no clue about Asja's choices, and sends that qubit on to Balvis. We will calculate the probabilty that the value of the bit which got measured by Balvis is same as Asja's initial value after Eve's interference. <br> \n","\n","Eve measured a qubit in a randomly selected basis, and initialized a new qubit with the value she just measured in same basis she just used, and will send to Balvis. If she chose the correct basis, Balvis will not notice Eve because she correctly reproduces same state. But if Eve chose wrong basis, then there are two possibilities: Asja used the $+$ basis and Eve chose $\\times$, and vice versa. <br>\n","In first case, Eve sees a $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or a $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ with probabilty $\\frac{1}{2}$, and she will send that qubit to Balvis after applying the Hadamard gate to it, because she is using the Bell basis, and whatever Eve measured, Balvis will see $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ since he will be using the other basis. Verify that Balvis will get random results with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the other case as well. <br>\n","\n","So the probabilty of Balvis getting a bit different than the one sent by Asja if Eve is involved is $\\frac{1}{2}*\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$, the probabilty of Eve choosing the incorrect basis times probabilty of Balvis seeing the wrong bit. \n","Then probabilty that Asja and Balvis will notice Eve if she listens to their communication after testing $n$ bits is $1-(\\frac{3}{4})^n$ which is greater than $0.999999999$ after $n>72$.\n","\n","### Implementation in Qiskit"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dO8YeYWu8aIY","colab_type":"code","outputId":"3e9ef298-a7f6-4692-a24f-35f6640d1706","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1576006012432,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1004,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmet","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_Iwyx6XPlu8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXA/4UANs2F-QAo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"17556433434459467790"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":194}},"source":["from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","\n","# Length of message\n","n = 10\n","# Number of qubits for protocol\n","sz = 4*n\n","\n","qreg = QuantumRegister(sz)\n","creg = ClassicalRegister(sz)\n","circ = QuantumCircuit(qreg,creg)\n","\n","# flip coin to decide initial values\n","arr1 = np.random.randint(2, size=sz)\n","print(\"Asja's initialization\")\n","print(arr1)\n","\n","# apply x gate for 1s, do nothing for 0s\n","for i in range(sz):\n","    if arr1[i] == 1:\n","        circ.x(qreg[sz-i-1])\n","        \n","# flip coins to decide gates        \n","arr2 = np.random.randint(2, size=sz)\n","print(\"Asja's Basis\")\n","print(arr2)\n","for i in range(sz):\n","    if arr2[i] == 1:\n","        circ.h(qreg[sz-i-1])\n","\n","# Asja sends qubits\n","        \n","# Eve decides randomly to listen or not        \n","spy = np.random.randint(2)\n","if spy == 1:\n","    #
