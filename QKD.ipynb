    "Asja wants to send messages to Balvis who will go abroad but they want to keep touch. But Eve, their curious friend, want to learn what they will talk. Asja and Balvis found a solution called one time padding. Before he leave they randomly produce (for examle by flipping a coin) a binary string with length $n$. Whenever Asja wants to send a message, first she $XOR$ her message with this string and after Belvis has message, he $XOR$ again with the same string. In this situation Eve can't find the message because there are many possible ($2^n$) strings Asja and Balvis can produce by flipping coin.\n",

If she sees a tail, qubit remain zero otherwise she sets qubit to one. Then she flips coin again to decide actually what basis she use for every qubit. So Asja have randomly created $0$ or $1$ qubits in Bell or computational basis. Then she sends qubits to Balvis without sending information about initial values and basis. When he recive qubits, he randomly chooses basis and measures them. After measurement Asja and Balvis shares their basis information using classical channels. Approximately Asja and Balvis aggree on half, $2n$, of them. Focus these $2n$ qubits (Asja and Balvis restart all procudure if there are less then $2n$ aggrements). If they make measurenments on same basis, they should have same values on these qubits. But Eve can listen their coumminication. If Eve listens, there is probility greater than zero that Asja and Balvis has different qubits. They share same random $n$ of $2n$ qubits values and then compair with each other, if there is a different qubit then they restart because Eve is listening.

    "## Calculating Probabilty of Asja and Balvis don't Notice Eve\n",
    "\n",
    "Let Eve listens Asja and Balvis. She makes measurements in random basis for every qubit. Because every qubit is independent, lets think of one qubit. We will calculate the probabilty of Balvis measures correct result as Asja send after Eve's observation. Eve measures a qubit with random basis, and initial new qubit with same basis and value as she measured and send to Balvis. If she choose correct basis, Balvis don't notice Eve because she correctly reproduce same state as Asja. But if Eve choose wrong basis there are two situations: Asja choose $+$ and Eve choose $x$ and vice versa. First case, Eve has $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probabilty, and she sends qubit after applying Hadamard to Balvis and whatever Eve measure again Balvis has $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other case, Asja prepares qubit in $x$ basis and Eve measures in $+$ basis, again she randomly measure $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle $ or $ \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ and send them to Balvis in $+$ basis. Balvis make measurenments in $x$ basis and for both situations he gets random results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So probabilty Asja and Balvis make different measurenments if Eve involves is $\\frac{1}{2}*\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$, probabilty Eve choose incorrect basis times probabilty Balvis' measurenment is different then Asja's initial bit. \n",
    "So probabilty Asja and Balvis don't notice Eve if she listens them and test $n$ of $2n$ bits they agree on is $1-(\\frac{3}{4})^n$ which is greater than $0.999999999$ after $n>72$"
